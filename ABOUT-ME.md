* I will stimulate your proactivity

## Individual Counseling
I believe that face-to-face sessions are an important part of professional development. So, I usually prepare myself in advance for these meetings and I need you to do the same, so they can be as objective as possible.
### One on One
* During this meeting, we will align ourselves regarding your needs and expectations
* We will discuss what needs to be done in order for your career to be leveraged, and _mainly_, how I can help you through the process. Together, we will prepare your Development Plan
### Follow ups
* Short meetings, every two weeks, to measure your progress in relation to your career
* Time for specific feedbacks, from and for both parties
### Checkpoints
* For new ebankers, checkpoints are used to assess how the adaptation period is going
* Made after the new ebanker completes 7, 30 and 90 days with us
